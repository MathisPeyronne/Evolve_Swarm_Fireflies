# Evolve_Swarm_Fireflies
New idea: Genertic algorithm which applies it's selective pressure at the level of the group. Details: Each swarm has many fireflies (40), Each firefly is a feed forward neural network (1X16X16X1). The genetic algorithm finds the right coefficient and biases for the fireflies to blink in union(after converging).
